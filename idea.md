## Timespan
The game will last one real weeks per season and new features should release each season.

Each day lasts 80 seconds. This might get longer in the future as might the game time length.

This means that a potential journey from London to Port Royal (~8 weeks) would take ~1h14m.

## Initial features
The first few versions will be a bit simple to allow for setting up later features.

To start with every port will have routes to every other port with a simple cost of time. The markets will also be simple fixed buy and sell pricing.

The starting features will be, a single boat type, and the ability to buy more. The ability to buy and sell from NPC traders in ports. The ability to buy and and sell to other players via each ports marketboard. And the ability to store products in warehouses upto a limit.
